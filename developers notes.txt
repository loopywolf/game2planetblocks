Developer Notes: Game#2 - AddyPokemon

MILESTONES

Step 1. Goal: Little man moves on map, can shoot enemies, but real assets (done?)
	(v)little man 
	(v)tilemap 
	(v)enemy real assets
	(v)little man moves with WASD
	(v)enemy exists
	(v)enemy takes damage from shots
	(v)enemy dies with enough damage
	(v)shoot at mouse cursor
	(v)your guy takes damage when he touches monsters

Step 2. Goal: man can gather items and place items
	(v)pick up items
	(x)click on tile fires a gathering projectile - I am able to identify which tile but only sometimes and only by number
		I can get name of tile, but it takes a bit of work and needs cleaned up
	(v)clicking on a tile near the player gathers it
	(x)gathering project turns a tile into an item

Step 3. Inventory (was also and placing items/tiles)
	(v)inventory (was also building mode) GUI
	(v)when inventory is active,..
		(v)displays inventory
		(>)can select an item
		(>)clicking on the map places tile within BUILD_DISTANCE
	(v)clicking (I) activates inventory
	(v)gathering a tile adds in inventory
	TODO: move camera to center better when GUI is in place
	TODO: breaking a block produces a bunch of items

Game#2 scope change - you are the lander, build base, repair ship - expandable

Step 4. Replace little guy with a lander
	(v)lander turns with AD and moves forward/backwards with WS
	TODO: nice chomper animation

Step 5. Start building out the map
	(v)create crashed spaceship (hull block)
	(v)reate base rock tiles in a sort of level (base rock block)
	(x)BUG: Lander will not turn while moving - it does, actually

Step 6a. First Mission
	Collect minerals to build a fab o mat
	notice sessile creatures
	look for Element-1
	(v)updated lander artwork (easy)

Step 6b. Placing items/tiles
